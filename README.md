# shelly-tnh-to-prom 

A very basic app to test some MQTT and Prometheus stuff in .NET.

The app (for now) simply takes a single double value and publishes it as a prometheus gauge.

There is probably better ways to do this but this way I get to test some nugets :) 

### Todo
  * ~~Adjust app to the Shelly Plus H&T Sensor (Gen 3) which I will use to monitor my home~~
  * Fix the graceful shutdown in docker on Linux that seems to be a pain in the a**
  *
